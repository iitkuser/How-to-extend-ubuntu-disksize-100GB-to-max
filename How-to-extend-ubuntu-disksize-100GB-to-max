Resizing a Logical Volume in Ubuntu

To resize a logical volume and make use of additional space, follow these steps:
Step 1: Resize the Physical Volume

Resize the physical volume to take advantage of the additional space:

bash

sudo pvresize /dev/sda3

Step 2: Check the Volume Group Size

Verify the volume group size and available free space:

bash

sudo vgdisplay

Look for the Free PE (Physical Extents) field to see how much free space is available in the volume group.
Step 3: Extend the Logical Volume

Extend the logical volume to use all available free space in the volume group:

bash

sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv

Replace /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv with your actual logical volume path if it differs.
Step 4: Resize the File System

Resize the file system to utilize the newly extended logical volume space:

bash

sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv

Step 5: Verify the Changes

Check the disk usage to confirm the increased size:

bash

df -h

This command will display the updated disk space for your root (/) partition.
