## Resizing the Ubuntu server disk partition

### Step 1: Resize the Physical Volume

Run the following command to resize the physical volume and take advantage of the additional space:

```bash
sudo pvresize /dev/sda3

### Step 2: Check the Volume Group Size

Verify that the volume group has more space available by checking the "Free PE" (Physical Extents) field:

```bash
sudo vgdisplay


### Step 3: Extend the Logical Volume

Extend the logical volume to use all available free space in the volume group:

```bash
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv


### Step 4: Resize the File System

Resize the file system to fill the newly expanded logical volume:

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv


### Step 5: Verify the Changes

Check the disk usage to verify that the root (/) partition size has been increased:

```bash
df -h





---------------



sudo parted /dev/sda
Set the Unit to TB (to make it easier to view the entire disk space):

bash
Copy code
(parted) unit TB
Print the Partition Table (to confirm current layout):

bash
Copy code
(parted) print
Resize Partition 3:

Find the start point of /dev/sda3 from the output. Then, use the resizepart command to extend it to the maximum size.
For example:
bash
Copy code
(parted) resizepart 3 100%
Exit parted:

bash
Copy code
(parted) quit
Reboot the System:

bash
Copy code
sudo reboot
Resize Physical Volume and Logical Volume: After reboot, extend the physical and logical volumes as before:

bash
Copy code
sudo pvresize /dev/sda3
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
Resize the Filesystem:

bash
Copy code
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
Verify the Available Space:

bash
Copy code
df -h





### Summary of Commands

```bash
Copy code
sudo pvresize /dev/sda3
sudo vgdisplay
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
df -h
lsblk



Following these steps should resolve the issue and your root partition should now be expanded to take full advantage of the additional space.





----------

vgdisplay | grep "Free  PE"
