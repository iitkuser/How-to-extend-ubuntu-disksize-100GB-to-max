## Resizing the Ubuntu server disk partition

### Step 1: Resize the Physical Volume

Run the following command to resize the physical volume and take advantage of the additional space:

```bash
sudo pvresize /dev/sda3

### Step 2: Check the Volume Group Size

Verify that the volume group has more space available by checking the "Free PE" (Physical Extents) field:

```bash
sudo vgdisplay


### Step 3: Extend the Logical Volume

Extend the logical volume to use all available free space in the volume group:

```bash
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv


### Step 4: Resize the File System

Resize the file system to fill the newly expanded logical volume:

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv


### Step 5: Verify the Changes

Check the disk usage to verify that the root (/) partition size has been increased:

```bash
df -h





### Summary of Commands

```bash
Copy code
sudo pvresize /dev/sda3
sudo vgdisplay
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
df -h
lsblk



Following these steps should resolve the issue and your root partition should now be expanded to take full advantage of the additional space.
